# Examination Management ERP System - UI/UX Design for NSBM Green University

This is a UI/UX Design Project for an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system created to efficiently manage the examination process at NSBM Green University. The primary focus of this project is to design a simple, intuitive, and efficient User Experience (UX) and User Interface (UI) for various stakeholders including Students, Lecturers, Exam Coordinators, Administrators, and Invigilators at NSBM.
